## DatasStructure and Algorithm with C lang 

### Purpose
One of the subjects in term 2 of BCIT CST is C lang, and I find it meaningful to review it and organize Data Structures and Algorithms. 

I plan to summarize one or more concepts every day, and accordingly, I intend to organize the source code by creating a folder structure for the concepts.

### Topics

| ADT | DataStructure |
| --- | ------------- |
| List | LinkedList , Double LinkedList, Circular LinkedList |
| Stack | Array-based-Stack , LinkedList-based-Stack |
| Queue  | Circular Queue , Linked Queue |
| Tree | Binary Tree , LCRS Tree , Red-Black Tree |
| Graph | Directed Graph , Undirected Graph |
| Heap | Array-based-heap , LinkedList-based-heap |

* ADT (Abstract Data Type) = A set of operations that a datastructure should support
* LCRS (Left-Child Right-Sibling)
